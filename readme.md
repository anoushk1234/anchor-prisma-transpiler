# Sqlana ⚡️

## Introduction

Let's say you wrote a solana program using anchor, now you want to build a dapp, you have two options either use an indexer and rely on your contract for data or have a database and api. Both approaches require a database schema~

## Introducing _Sqlana_ ⚡️

A transpiler for all our schemas.<br>
Anchor program IDL -> Prisma Schema △ <br>
Anchor program IDL -> SQL Schema 💿 <br>
Anchor program IDL -> Graphql Schema 🕸 <br>

Currently this works with Prisma Schema but we want to add support for more.

# Quickstart

- `yarn install`
- Add the idl json file in idl.json
- `yarn setup` (only for first time otherwise yarn start)
