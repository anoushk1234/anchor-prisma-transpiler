# Sqlana ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Introduction

Let's say you wrote a solana program using anchor, now you want to build a dapp, you have two options either use an indexer and rely on your contract for data or have a database and api. Both approaches require a database schema~

## Introducing _Sqlana_ ‚ö°Ô∏è

A transpiler for all our schemas.<br>
Anchor program IDL -> Prisma Schema ‚ñ≥ <br>
Anchor program IDL -> SQL Schema üíø <br>
Anchor program IDL -> Graphql Schema üï∏ <br>

Currently this works with Prisma Schema but we want to add support for more.
